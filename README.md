# Blog Templating Project with npoint.io, Flask and Jinja
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  

- 🧑‍💻 The Blog Templating Flask/Jinja/Python project shows how to use Jinja to exploit Python code within a html document to order to lever templating aspects of the document.  A simple class was implemented as a data store so that methods requiring access to identical data will have access. npoint.io is used here to create an api quickly for a more realistic simulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
